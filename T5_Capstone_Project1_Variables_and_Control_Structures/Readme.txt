# Financial Calculator Project

## Introduction:
This project is a program that allows users to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator. It was created for a small financial company that needed a tool to assist their clients with financial calculations.

## Features:
The program has two main features: investment calculator and home loan repayment calculator. The investment calculator helps users to calculate the amount of interest they will earn on their investment, based on the amount of money deposited, interest rate, years planned to invest and the type of interest (simple or compound). The home loan repayment calculator helps users to calculate the amount they will have to repay each month for a home loan, based on the present value of the house, interest rate, and number of months over which the bond will be repaid.

## Instructions:
To use the program, simply run the financial_calculator.py script in your preferred Python environment. You will be presented with a menu that asks you to choose between the investment calculator and the home loan repayment calculator. Follow the prompts and input the required information for the chosen calculator. The program will output the results of the calculation.

## Dependencies:
The program uses the built-in Python math module.
